# Get recipe id from webpage uri.

Each receipe has two possible format and we will need to be able to support both of them.

I was using their webpage to find desired recipe with url:
http://food2fork.com/view/Crash_Hot_Potatoes/47319

another url format (which will redirect to previous url) is:
http://food2fork.com/view/47319

47319 seams to be recipe id
